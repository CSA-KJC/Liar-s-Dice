# Liar-s-Dice

Bids - Each player has 5 dice. You can see your own dice but not each other's. Each player bids the amount of dice a single face value has. Each bid must be higher than the previous one in number or face value. Ex: Five 2's --> Six 2's OR Five 3's

Call - You may only challenge the bid given from the previous player. If the bid is equal to or less than the actual amount, the challenger loses and the bidder wins. But if they bid more than the actual amount, the bidder lose.

Exact - You may only call exact on the bid given from the previous player. If there is exactly what was bid, the challenger wins. If there is not, the bidder wins and the challenger loses.

Whoever loses each call or exact loses a dice

Objective: Be the last player with dice
